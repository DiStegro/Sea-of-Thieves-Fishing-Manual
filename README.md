# Sea-of-Thieves-Fishing-Manual
Sea of Thieves is a game where you get to be a pirate, follow treasure maps, dig for gold, fight skeletons and ghosts, battle ships from your ships using cannons! Unfortunately they included a fishing minigame, so we will be actively avoiding those things in favour of fishing.

This is intended to be played on Safer Seas, to avoid running into players that might sink your checks, though the logic is unchanged if you want a risk and choose to play on the High Seas

# Randomized Items
- Map regions
- Bait
- Ponds/Shipwrecks
- A Stove
- Ranks with the Hunter's Call

Send locations by selling specific items to the Hunter's Call, mostly fish but does include other meat as well.

# Victory Goal
Victory is achieved when you qualify for 'Master Hunter' by finding 50 ranks for the Hunter's Call

# Additional Notes
Base fish, trophy fish and cooked fish checks are intended to stack to save waiting around unnecessarily for multiple copies of the same fish because you caught a lucky trophy
Rare fish variants have not been included because of their sheer rarity, I recommend treating them as a wildcard in case some particular fish is giving you grief
Pondies logically expect access to Mermaid's Hideaway, no one likes losing fish to rocks and this makes that as unlikely as possible
Wreckers logically expect access to all four regions, this is to push them later in the logic since they're the least guaranteed fish included in this randomizer, rather than as a hard blocker
Battlegills and Stormgills have not been included, I deemed the fort RNG and the storm cycle too slow to feel good in play, but I'm happy to help if someone would like to make another version with them included
